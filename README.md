# Hospital ERP System

This project implements a hospital ERP system with modules like HR, Inventory, Billing, Patient Records, etc. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features
- HR Management
- Inventory Management
- Billing and Financial Management
- Patient Records

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB (either local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Local Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-erp.git
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and run the following command to install the necessary Node.js modules:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd hospital-erp
npm install
Configure MongoDB connection:

If using MongoDB Atlas: Create a MongoDB cluster in Atlas and obtain the connection URI.
Update the connection string in the config.js or in the app.js file.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const dbURI = 'mongodb+srv://your-user:your-password@cluster0.mongodb.net/hospital-erp?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
If using local MongoDB: Set the connection string to mongodb://localhost:27017/hospital-erp.
Start the application: Run the application locally by executing:

bash
Copy
Edit
node app.js
Access the app: Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

AWS Deployment
To deploy the application on AWS EC2, follow these steps:

Launch an EC2 instance:

Go to the AWS Management Console > EC2 > Launch Instance.
Choose an Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu instance (e.g., t2.micro for testing).
Configure security groups to allow:
22 (SSH)
80 (HTTP)
27017 (MongoDB, if using a local MongoDB on EC2)
Connect to EC2 via SSH:

Use the SSH key you downloaded when creating the instance to connect:
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns
Install Node.js and MongoDB on EC2:

Run the following commands to install Node.js:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
Install MongoDB (if you want to use it locally on EC2):
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install mongodb
Transfer your code to EC2:

You can either:
Clone your repository on EC2:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-erp.git
Use SCP to transfer files directly:
bash
Copy
Edit
scp -i your-key.pem -r ./hospital-erp ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns:/home/ubuntu/
Install dependencies: On EC2, navigate to the project folder and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd hospital-erp
npm install
Configure MongoDB connection: Ensure that the MongoDB connection string in your application points to the correct database (Atlas or EC2-hosted MongoDB).

Start the application: Run the application on EC2:

bash
Copy
Edit
node app.js
Access the app: Your application will be accessible via the EC2 public IP or DNS. Open your browser and go to http://your-ec2-public-dns.

Configuring Nginx as Reverse Proxy (Optional)
If you'd like to expose your app on port 80:

Install Nginx:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install nginx
Configure Nginx: Edit the default configuration file:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Update the server block to forward requests to your Node.js application (running on port 3000):

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-ec2-public-dns;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
Restart Nginx:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Now, your application should be accessible via http://your-ec2-public-dns.

Cloud Infrastructure Design
This Hospital ERP system is designed to be scalable and cost-effective for handling multiple hospitals concurrently. The infrastructure on AWS utilizes the following components:

EC2 Instances: To host the application and ensure scalability.
MongoDB Atlas: A managed database service for reliability and scalability.
AWS ElastiCache (Redis): To reduce database load and improve performance.
AWS Load Balancer: To balance traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability.
S3 Buckets: For static file storage (e.g., images, documents).
CloudWatch: To monitor application performance and alert on issues.
Cost Model
The cost model for the system is based on the following:
Compute Costs: EC2 instances (e.g., t2.micro) running the application.
Storage Costs: MongoDB Atlas or local database storage (if using EC2).
Network Costs: Bandwidth costs for serving the application and storing backups.
Detailed pricing information can be found on the AWS Pricing page.

Optimization Recommendations
To reduce costs and improve performance:

Auto-Scaling: Use EC2 Auto Scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
Spot Instances: Use AWS Spot Instances for lower-cost compute resources.
Use Caching: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and speed up response times.
Use CDN: Integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like AWS CloudFront to cache static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS) for faster delivery.
